## Futurs

Added new futurs Login Screen, Signup Screen, and Dashboard

On starting an application, the login screen will  show ans also sign-up screen added with an input field for the full name, email, phone number, and password.
I have hardcoded the email and password.
Email: test@gmail.com
Password: 123456

I am added validation to  email and password field to enter email password to not blank.
If the password matches, then the user will navigate to the dashboard screen.

Otherwise, we show an error message to user incurrect email or password.

I am designing a dashboard screen.
